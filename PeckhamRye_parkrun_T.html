    <h2>	Summary</h2>
	</p>
        <ul>
		<a href="https://www.parkrun.org.uk">parkrun</a> is a popular community 5km running event taking place on Saturday mornings in over 1,000 parks worldwide. There is also a junior version on Sundays (not covered here).</br></br>
		Peckham Rye held its first parkrun on 21st June 2014. There had been 472 parkruns at Peckham Rye, covering a period of just over a decade, at the time of writing. The most recent was on 17th August 2024. </br></br>
		The number of finishers has increased gradually over time, except for a break during the Covid-19 pandemic. </br></br>
		The number of finishers is greater, on average, at the start of the year. Finisher numbers generally decrease towards the end of the year and with lower participant numbers in the summer holiday period of July and August. </br></br>
		New Year parkruns are particularly popular at Peckham Rye; these events have some of the highest numbers of finishers. </br></br>
		The number of volunteers is less variable, averaging around 14-16 for all months over the decade. </br></br>
		The fastest finishing times have gradually improved for both male and female participants since the event started.</br></br>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	
        <ul>
		I started running at the <a href="https://www.parkrun.org.uk/peckhamrye"> Peckham Rye parkrun</a> in January 2024 and I really enjoy it. It was my new year's resolution to join the run once a month but in fact I just completed my 20th parkrun 
		at the start of August! I've seen my run times improve and it's increased my motivation to run regularly. </br></br>
		As well as the health and fitness benefits, it occurred to me that this activity must generate a lot of interesting
		data so I decided to do some analysis. The parkrun <a href="https://www.parkrun.org.uk/peckhamrye/results/eventhistory/">event history</a> page for each event provides information on the number of finishers, the number of volunteers, the fastest male and female finishers and their times,
		for each event since the parkrun started in 2014. </br></br>
		
		I wanted to finding out the following:</br></br>
		
		<li>How does the number of finishers change over time?</li>
		<li>What are the busiest times of year?</li>
		<li>How many volunteers are there and does this vary over time?</li>
		<li>How do the fastest finish times change over time?</li>
		<li>Are the winning times slower when more people are running?</li>
	
		</ul>
		 </div>
		<div class="content-section">
	<h2>Methods</h2>
	
		<ul>
		I used a  <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/discover"> Tableau Public</a> dashboard to display some of the core data. I made the dashboard in Tableau Public desktop, then published to Tableau Public online.
		I copied the embed code from Tableau Public to embed the dashboard into my page.	</br></br>
		
		<li>I copied and pasted data from the Peckham Rye event history page into a spreadsheet. parkrun asks people not to automatically scrape data from the website.</li>
		<li>I imported the data into Tableau. </li>
		<li>I used the Tableau data importing tool to format the dates, set the correct data types and calculate the first finisher times in minutes and seconds as decimals
		(this allows them to be plotted as numeric values). </li>
		<li>I imported location infomation from a separate file.</li>
		<li>I used the location to display a map, I plotted number of finishers over time and marked the minimum and maximum lines. I plotted the mean number of finishers and volunteers by month and I plotted the fastest monthly winner times for males 
		and females since the event started</li>
		<li>I added measures to format the first and latest event dates and the fastest finish times in minutes. </li>
		<li>I displayed these key stats on Power BI "cards". </li>
		</ul>
	<p></p>
	  <ul>
	  </div>
	  
	</body>
</div>
		<div class="content-section">
    <h2>What did I find?</h2>
        <ul>
	The analysis and visualisation showed the following:</br></br>
        <li>There was an increasing trend in number of finishers up until the Covid-19 pandemic forced a pause in the event from March 2020.</li>
        <li>When the event restarted in July 2021, the number of finishers was lower than pre-pandemic.</li>
        <li>Runner numbers then increased again and are now above pre-pandemic levels on average.</li>
		<li>The highest numbers of finishers occurred at two New Year's Day events in 2019 and 2020. The lowest number of finishers was on 27th December 2014. 
		This is likely due to taking place two days after Christmas and when the event was only recently established.</li>
		<li>The mean number of finishers is higher at the start of the year, with the greatest in January. This is likely due to people resolving to increase their exercise in the new year.</li>
        <li>Although the average drops off as the year progresses, participant numbers continue to increase since the event first started.</li>
		<li>There has been an overall improvement in fastest finish times for males and females during the time period. However, the fastest male finish has not been beaten since 1st January 2019 and the fastest
		female finish time has stood since 16th December 2017.</li>
		<li>No correlation was found between the number of finishers and fastest finish times. This is not displayed due to lack of findings.</li>
		
		</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="content-section">
		<h2>Is this what I expected?</h2>
		<ul>
		When I first started this parkrun it was extremely busy and it seems a bit quieter lately. Therefore I was unsurprised by the finding that the mean number of finishers is greater at the start of the year. However,
		I did not know if this was always the case since my own experience with parkrun covers only a small proportion of the time it has been running. </br></br>
		I have seen my finish times improve since I started taking part but it is interesting to see that overall fastest finish times have also improved gradually over time, suggesting that the event is making a positive 
		contribution to improving 5km running times more widely. </br></br>
		I was surprised that the number of finishers does not appear to affect the fastest finish times. Parts of the course are narrow, making it difficult to overtake and therefore I expected greater participant numbers to slow the pace but this was not the case. Other factors may be having a greater effect 
		on finish times than the number of participants.

		</ul>
		<div class="content-section">
		<h2>Further analysis</h2>
		<ul>
		Results pages are available for each event, providing much potential for further analysis.</br></br>
		Data for other parkruns could be imported to the same dashboard. It would be interesting to see if the trends are the same elsewhere.</br></br>
		Combining event data with meteorological data could provide further insight.
