    <h1>Analysis of Home Energy Use</h1>
    <p>I downloaded energy usage data from our energy supplier since the start of 2020. There is data for gas and electricity. I only used data which had actual meter readings, not estimates.
	I made some calculations in Excel, such as the number of days between meter readings which I then used to calculate average energy use per day over the time period. 
	
	I downloaded meteorological data from the NOAA Integrated Surface Database (ISD) using the worldmet package in R. 
	
	I imported the energy usage data and the met data into Python using pandas package. I processed the data in Python to calculate a mean air temperature for the period between each meter reading. 
	I merged the energy usage data with the temperature data and exported the results to csv files. Here is the Python script that I used:
